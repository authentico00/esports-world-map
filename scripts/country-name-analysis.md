# Country Name Analysis - Map Data vs Our System

## Key Findings

### Total Countries: 177 (from world-atlas data source)

### Countries with Abbreviated Names (Need Full Name Mappings):
1. **N. Cyprus** (undefined ID) → "North Cyprus" / "Northern Cyprus"
2. **Solomon Is.** (090) → "Solomon Islands" 
3. **Central African Rep.** (140) → "Central African Republic"
4. **Dem. Rep. Congo** (180) → "Democratic Republic of Congo" / "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
5. **Dominican Rep.** (214) → "Dominican Republic"
6. **Eq. Guinea** (226) → "Equatorial Guinea"
7. **Falkland Is.** (238) → "Falkland Islands"
8. **Fr. S. Antarctic Lands** (260) → "French Southern and Antarctic Lands"
9. **S. Sudan** (728) → "South Sudan"

### Special Cases:
1. **Kosovo** (undefined ID) - Already handled ✅
2. **Somaliland** (undefined ID) - Unrecognized territory
3. **Taiwan** (158) - Politically sensitive
4. **W. Sahara** (732) → "Western Sahara"

### Bosnia Naming:
- Map data: "Bosnia and Herz."
- Full name: "Bosnia and Herzegovina"

### Country Names That Are Good:
- Most countries have proper full names
- Sudan (729) and S. Sudan (728) are properly separated ✅

## Recommendations:

1. **Add name-based search mappings** for abbreviated names
2. **Update search function** to handle common abbreviations  
3. **Test search functionality** with both abbreviated and full names
4. **Consider alternative names** (e.g., "USA" for "United States of America")

## Search Function Impact:
Our current search is too strict and might miss countries with abbreviated names in the source data.
Need to add bidirectional mapping: 
- "Central African Republic" should find "Central African Rep."
- "Solomon Islands" should find "Solomon Is."
- etc.
