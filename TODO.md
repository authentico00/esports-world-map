### Performance Optimizations (New Section)

- [✅] **Flag Image Lazy Loading**

  - Added `loading="lazy"` to both hover modals
  - Flags only load when modal appears (on hover)
  - Reduces initial page load time and bandwidth usage

- [✅] **Advanced Image Preloading System**

  - **Tiered preloading**: 40+ countries across 3 tiers (1s, 3s, 6s delays)
  - **Tier 1**: Most common esports countries (US, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, South Korea, Japan, China, Australia, Canada)
  - **Tier 2**: Popular European & competitive regions (15 countries)
  - **Tier 3**: Emerging esports markets (15 countries)
  - **Intelligent region-based preloading**: Auto-preloads flags when regions selected
  - **Staggered loading**: Avoids bandwidth spikes
  - **Deduplication**: Uses Set to prevent duplicate preloading

- [✅] **Component Rendering Optimizations**

  - Memoized color calculations with `useCallback` and proper dependencies
  - Memoized opacity calculations with `useCallback`
  - Memoized stroke styles with `useMemo`
  - Prevents unnecessary re-calculations when regions/theme change

- [✅] **SVG Pattern Optimizations**

  - Reduced pattern size: 60x60 → 32x32 (33% smaller)
  - Replaced circles with rectangles for better GPU performance
  - Dynamic pattern opacity based on zoom level (reduces rendering at high zoom)
  - Optimized DOM order (defs before usage)
  - Fixed fuzzy rendering issues while maintaining performance gains

- [✅] **Smart Rendering System (Alternative to Virtualization)**
  - **Analysis**: Determined traditional virtualization unnecessary for SVG maps
  - **Zoom-based filtering**: Only renders 14 major countries at 1x zoom, all 241 at 1.5x+
  - **94% reduction** in rendered elements at world view
  - **Explanation**: SVG paths are lightweight, browser handles spatial culling
  - **Better approach**: Smart filtering > virtualization for maps

### Code Quality

- [✅] **Removed debug console spam**
- [✅] **Added comprehensive error handling** for undefined country codes
- [✅] **Enhanced country detection** with multiple fallback methods

### Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements (Latest Session)

- [✅] **Search hover modal region detection fix**

  - **Issue**: Search functionality showing "not assigned to any region" for most countries
  - **Root cause**: Manual region lookup table only covered ~20 countries vs 280+ available
  - **Solution**: Integrated with existing COUNTRY_REGIONS mapping for complete coverage
  - **Impact**: All searched countries now display correct regional information
  - **Technical**: Replaced hardcoded lookup with `COUNTRY_REGIONS[countryCode.toUpperCase()]`
  - **Edge cases**: Added Kosovo fallback handling for undefined country codes

- [✅] **Fixed multiple country selection on single click**

  - **Root cause**: Event bubbling and overlapping SVG boundaries causing multiple Geography components to receive click events
  - **Solution**: Enhanced event prevention with processing flag and immediate propagation stopping
  - **Technical**: `stopImmediatePropagation()` + `preventDefault()` + 250ms processing lock
  - **Impact**: Clean single-country selection with robust protection against multiple selections
